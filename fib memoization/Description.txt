Write a function fib(n)' that takes in a number as an argument.
The function should return the n-th number of the Fibonacci sequence.

The 1st and 2nd number of the sequence is 1.
To generate the next number of the sequence, we sum the previous two.

The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci algorithm's time complexity is O(2^n),
which is poor compared to the dynamic programming method which is optimized to have a better time complexity of O(n).
